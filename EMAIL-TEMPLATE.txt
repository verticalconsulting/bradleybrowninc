Hi Bradley,

Great news! Your website payment system is now live with four convenient payment options for your clients:

✅ READY TO USE (No setup needed):
• Zelle - FREE bank transfers (0% fees - highly recommended!)
• Venmo - Mobile payments (@bradleybrowninc)

⚠️ ACTION REQUIRED (10 minutes):
• Stripe - Credit card payments (needs your payment link setup)

🔄 OPTIONAL:
• Klarna - Financing for projects $1,000+ (optional merchant application)

Visit your new payment page: https://bradleybrowninc.com/payment

NEXT STEPS:

1. CRITICAL: Set up your Stripe payment link (detailed instructions attached)
   - Takes 10-15 minutes
   - Required to accept credit/debit cards
   - No monthly fees, just pay-as-you-go

2. OPTIONAL: Apply for Klarna financing (if you want to offer payment plans)
   - Takes 2-5 business days for approval
   - Great for larger projects
   - Skip if most payments are under $1,000

3. Start using Zelle immediately for big savings
   - Clients send to: bradleybrowninc@gmail.com
   - Zero fees - you keep 100% of every payment
